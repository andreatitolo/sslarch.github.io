## Administrative matters

- The slack chat software is not suitable for us any more, because it deletes messages after 90 days. Martin Hinz and Joe Roe will prepare an experimental setup with the matrix chat software, which we can explore and discuss in the next meeting

## Conferences, meetings and sessions

- CAA2023:
  - The SIG session *S15. Reproducing, Reusing, and Revising Code and Data in Archaeology* should be advertised a bit more in the following two weeks until the abstract submission deadline is reached
  - Sophie Schmidt and Joe Roe will look into the possibility of handing in a workshop proposal - probably an updated rerun of one of the previous workshops

## SIG activities

- Teaching material list: A number of ToDos are open and we distributed tasks to make progress

## Next meeting: Monday, November 7, 2022
