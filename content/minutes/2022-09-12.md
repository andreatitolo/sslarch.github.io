## Show&Tell

[Christopher Carleton](https://wccarleton.me/) talked about his work and workflow in and around computational archaeology. Christopher has published multiple highly relevant papers in this domain. Just to name a few:

Christopher shared some insights into the more intricate details of how he uses scripting languages and computational tools for reproducible analysis.
