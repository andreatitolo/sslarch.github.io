# open exchange

## EAA
- happened.
- very full conference, great fun for those attending
- two sessions interesting to computational archaeology, we would like to hear more about:

### archaeoriddle
- we would like to invite Simon and Alfredo (Cambridge) to talk about it at CAA

### code sustainability workshop
- by Dries Draems
- gave a shoutout to computational world map
- sadly he couldn't talk, so hopefully he can tell us more next time


## recursive programming in R and infinite sequences
- Clemens recommends a blogpost:  https://jcarroll.com.au/2023/08/18/taking-from-infinite-sequences
- Clemens example:
    - using Haskell and repl as an interactive compiler
    - you can ask for an infinite number and it just starts counting
    - can be nice for indexing -> give a list concrete indices
    - we don't have to count anymore, how many indices we need, we can just ask it to stop when our list is done being indexed
    - manipulation of infinite lists can't be done in every language -> but you can do that in Haskell by mapping for this infinite list ,
        - e.g. to get only a list of even numbers (by doubling all entries)
        - and then you can just get the first ten entries and because Haskell is lazy it will then only calculate the first ten values
    - you can do the same in R via recursion (R doesn't have infinitive data structures by default) and then measure how deep we are in the recursion to "stop" at a certain point (like take the ten first values)
    - but be careful with sys.calls (if your environment is not clean, this will not get you the correct number, because you've already done a few sys calls)
    - R is a lazy language which makes it in theory sometimes very efficient
- comments:
    - lazyness can be interesting by database queries
    - it's more a fun exercise to learn more about the quirks of a language ;-)


# SSLA Matrix channel within the workspace of chat.archaeo.social hosted by Joe Roe

- on chat.archaeo.social there are e.g. jobs-channel, resource-channel ->  check out the links postet there, there is some activity
- joined forces with other computational archaeology groups like Rchaeology

- **please make an account** and request access to the SIG SSLA channel either on the social platform or via Email to Clemens or Sophie (tell us your username for archaeo.social then)

- deadline: **WE WILL CLOSE DOWN SLACK IN 2 MONTH!**

# next meeting
- 02nd of October 2023
- Dries will ask the archaeoriddle people to join us and present their project
