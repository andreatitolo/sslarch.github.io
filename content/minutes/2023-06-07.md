## Open exchange
- Recommendations:
	- A new book on network analysis in archaeology: https://book.archnetworks.net/
	- A didactic blog post on LLMs: https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/
	- A new R package/framework to use R for web applications: https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr
- A number of important, geospatial R packages will be removed from CRAN, which has important implications for long-term reproducibility: https://r-spatial.org/r/2023/05/15/evolution4.html

## SIG activities
- Joe Roe and Sophie Schmidt still plan to give a workshop about [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), maybe in the context of the next CAA meeting
- Multiple SIG members participate in the CAA's "Future conferences task force", that was created to improve the annual meetings
- Joe Roe hosts an [element](https://element.io/) instance (https://chat.archaeo.social). He will create a workspace there for the SIG SSLA and we will migrate over from our Slack chat. Slack will be connected to this new environment through a bridge
- Sophie Schmidt will create a Mastodon account for the SIG to slowly retire our Twitter account

## Next SIG Meeting: Wednesday, August 2, 2023
We will try to invite Matt Peeples to talk about **Network Science in Archaeology** (see above)
