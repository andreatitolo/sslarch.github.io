## Talk by Lucy Timbrell

Timbrell, L., Grove, M., Manica, A. et al. A spatiotemporally explicit paleoenvironmental framework for the Middle Stone Age of eastern Africa. Sci Rep 12, 3689 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-07742-y

- explicit model for precipitation and temperature at Middle Stone Age sites during several interglacial phases

- reconstructs changes in behaviour and use of ecotones

- all code in R
- data and code online at https://osf.io/y98rq/
- used data from: https://osf.io/8n43x 

- go read it.

## Discussion

- preprint on research square got one comment, which came too late to be incorporated into revised version 
 - preprints can speed up the scientific progress, if accepted and read

- there's a new package [{pastclim}](https://github.com/EvolEcolGroup/pastclim)  that makes using paleoclimatic data easier
- huge files for paleoclimatic reconstructions sometimes make handling difficult
 - using only two variables made this easier

- why use Github and not OSF.io?
 - they do different things:
 - Github shines when used collaboratively to develop code
 - OSF.io is a good place for long term storage of data and code

- great open work:
 - links between published paper and code / data online in both directions
 - small introduction how to run the code at the beginning of script
 - use of long term archive OSF
