# news:
    - new discord channel for computational archaeology: https://discord.com/invite/Z9UXwjASM5

## update on CAA:
    - we've got a (lightening talk) session #S15
    - workshop on Git and Github has been submitted

## chapter meeting Germany/Netherlands 
    -  CfP until 1st of July 
    - takes place October 5th-6th

# teaching materials list

## google doc:
    - finalise: tagging
    - see whether the tutorials are complete with info so far
    - add more edges to go on the map as routes

## teaching materials map (https://github.com/sslarch/MapofComputationalArchaeology):
    - access needed via the github of SSLARCH
    - can be exported as png tiles
    - need to look whether the github server needs any infrastructure to properly work with leaflet to properly display the tiles

### lists- group
    - to dos in filling the data base:
        - Zack: tools used, programming, short description, topic, open archeo tags
        - Sophie: Authors and year created, language
    - edges between cities: 
    - with direction from easier to more complicated
        - todo Jim: Netlogo learning paths
        - todo Sophie: starts on R learning paths
    - would it be sensible to create a script that takes the tags according to the maps group to automatically place the "tutorial-cities"? 

 
### map group 
    - there is a github repo which takes the maps and visualises them
    - we can take this as a discussion basis for which to link and where to place tutorial-cities
