## Organisational matters

- Discussion on structure and content of the regular SIG-SSLA meetings
  - Ideas in the conversation
	  - The current monday date is an issue for some people, but there is no obvious need for another meeting time survey
    - The SIG-SSLA meeting will most likely always stay a rather small event, due to the limited total size of the computational archaeology community
	  - The group's practical activitis should be more of a focus: e.g. Martin Hinz's text book project or the teaching material list
	  - The Show&Tell presentations are a clear pull-factor, that should be emphasized
	- Concrete decisions
	  - We want to put more focus on the Show&Tell section:
	    - They will be repositioned to happen at the beginning of the meetings
	    - We will explicitly invite authors of (recently) published papers to present their work (Ben Marwick's CTV has a section with [relevant papers](https://github.com/benmarwick/ctv-archaeology#publications-that-include-r-code))
	    - The presentations should still be small, informal lightning talks with a focus on hands-on exploration of the code in a given paper
	  - We want to experiment with an alternating structure, where we switch between more Show&Tell-focused and more project work-focused meetings
