## SIG activities

- Teaching material list: Sophie Schmidt has shared a google document in the respective slack channel. Please invest some minutes of brainstorming to add the relevant materials you know.

## Discussion
- interesting blogs 
    - [LaTeX Ninja](latex-ninja.com/)
    - [Alison Hill  on using blogdown](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2020-12-new-year-new-blogdown/)
    - [Ben Marwick on using Atom](https://github.com/benmarwick/atom-for-scholarly-writing-with-markdown)

## Show and tell

- Show and tell focused on pipeline tools
- Compiling software projects is similar to running data analysis scripts, one needs to run a number of scripts / functions in a certain order
- Therefore there are pipeline tools for any kind of scripting language "out there"
- Several pipeline tools can be found here: <https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline> 

- Ben Marwick introduced the R packages {targets} and {renv}
    - {targets}
        - if you use Rmarkdown and don't want all analysis steps to run every time you knit and dislike the caching knitr offers
        - target "flips" the process
        - the analysis steps are outsourced to functions in separate scripts
        - _targets.R is the "recipe book" similar to a make-file that defines the run order of the scripts
        - at the end the document is knitted
        - this way: unchanged scripts are skipped (and there is a load function for data, which will "alert" the later scripts if the data has been changed)
        - in the RMD you only reference to the images you create with the scripts
        - especially well suited for tasks that take long to compute
        - active maintainer
        - corresponding article: <https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02959>
        - tutorial: <https://wlandau.github.io/targets-tutorial/#1>
    - {renv}
        - "better packrat"
        - saves your package versions in a renv.lock file
        - the Rprofile file sources renv action, which compares the versions of your session / project which those given in the renv.lock
        - alerts you to changes and uses the package versions given in renv.lock, but doesn't overwrite any of your packages (if you close the project, everything returns to default)
        - three functions needed: `renv::init()`, `renv::snapshot()` and `renv::restore()`
        - easier than the rrtools workflow using the DESCRIPTION file
        
- Clemens showed the haskell based `Shake` and described the same steps as detailed in [his blog post](https://nevrome.medium.com/my-workflow-automation-journey-discovering-shake-haskell-5c270b93ff2b)
    - shake only needs stack 
    - within a shakefile the rules in which order to run which scripts and what are input and output data are defined
    - Clemens created some operators to reduce the complexity of the rules syntax in a shakefile

    
## Next meeting: Monday, January 10, 2022

- everyone: Happy holidays and merry Christmas to everyone celebrating! 
- Have a great start into the new year, looking forward to seeing you again!
