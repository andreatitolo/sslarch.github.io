## Open exchange
​
### show casing of some databases
- Robert shows the "Heurist" database by ian johnson database: archaeology, social science
	- is easy to upload data (even 3D data)
	- heurist.huma.num.fr
	- built in record sheets, map, etc, quite general purpose
	- https://heurist.huma-num.fr/heurist/startup/
- node-goat: graph database  
	- https://nodegoat.net
	- easy to use for network analysis
- arches database
	- https://eamena-project.github.io/eamena-arches-dev/talks/2023-gmpca/pres/#/arches-it-stack
​
### computational environments
- recent article about computational environments https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-01469-0 
- discusses the renv R package, Ben Marwick was interviewed briefly for it, along with many others
​
### new methods
- most archaeological data is visual data
- triple IF to describe image (https://iiif.io/)
- JSON format
- 3Dhop will develop sth similar for 3D
​
## CAA wrap up
- SIG SSLA had a good meeting in person
- SIG SSLA had a successful session
- CAA ethics officer is being needed!	
​
### very high CAA conference fees
- CAA steering committee is aware it
- task force is being developed to discuss new ideas about that 
- at the moment mostly men, middle-aged and from Europe
- call to diversify! if you are interested, please join
- discussion:
	- needs to be more accessible
	- needs more outreach, esp. to Asia and Africa
	- more accessibility via hybrid
	- "international" is in the name
	- professional conference centers are the main trouble (high fees, equipment is expensive) --> go somewhere else, esp. universities
	- in European context it's unusual not to be at university, in other areas (North America) it is more usual to be at a conference center
	- more open about the size of the bursary for students, so they can plan according
- Jim and Martin may be part of the task force, don't hesitate to contact them
​
## SIG SSLA computational archaeology map
- <https://sslarch.github.io/MapofComputationalArchaeology/>
- filtering and searching mechanism is more user-friendly now (tags are click-able), search more inclusive (across all fields)
- please: everyone add new entries 
- will be tweeted about soon! 
- map is written in Elm, may need some familiarity to get used to it, if you are interested to check it out
​
## geometric morphometrics
​
### talk by David Matzig
- on his PhD to use Geometric Morphometric Methods (GMM) and phylogenetic comparative methods (PCM) -> to assess stone tool typologies and study the cultural evolution
- part of CLIOARCH
- traditional morphometrics and landmark based GMM use some human-chosen feature points for comparison
- outline based GMM -> equally spaced points + elliptic fourier analysis --> doesn't need human decision process and can be automated
- package outlineR -> extracts outlines from pictures
- Momocs: elliptic fourier transformation and PCA
- -> this can be clustered
- paper with Hussain and Riede in Journal of Paleolithic Archaeology 2021
	- compared whole-outline GMM to typology based study
	- Nicolas 2017 data (typologcal methods) compared with output from this workflow 
	- -> quite successful in recreating typochronology and clustering of regions 
- future work:
	- use bayesian phylogenies 
	- inferred by a tree-partite models (Watnock & Wright 2020)
	- planned outcome: tree typology which can be used to infer new 
	- planned outcome: extinction rates, technological evolution random or not?
	- will be tested for correlation with climate, hunting strategies etc
​
### talk by Robert Bischoff
- plans a regional study in SW of USA (between Arizona and New Mexico)
- projectile point typologies are not well developed and not comparable within the area
- GMM used for re-analysis:
	- Fourrier does not capture variation in side notches, which are shallow + many points are broken
	- therefore used landmark analysis with equal distance of points
	- tips are not included in the analysis (no landmarks at the points)
	- program: tpsDig2
	- generalised procrastis alignment --> so that all points are on the same plane 
- PCA, hierarchical clustering similar to Davids method
- network by PCA distances and prject the outline of the points -> easier to see clusters
- many similarities, also between clusters
- use this approach to compare sites (similar/distance based)
- compare different networks (architecture, pottery, projectile points)
- network as a graph tool
- preprint: https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a6wjc/
​
### discussion
- nearest neighbor, split graph (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_graph) to work with the tree -> is a mixture of a tree and a network 
- Thomas Huet uses Davids data for teaching: http://shinyserver.cfs.unipi.it:3838/teach/stats/upv3/_site/#/dim-data-shape
- visualisation of networks: sometimes readers mix up the weight of the edge by colour with the distance between the nodes "in print"
- careful with displaying algorithms
- good idea to sometimes use landmarks, well reasoned 
- canonical analysis, redundancy analysis can be used for to check for clusters
- alternatives to PCA? 
	- David: without PCA, just Fourrier -> works the same, but PCA gives a nice visual summary
	- Martin: does not highlight small changes as well, used t-SNE (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding)
	- David: yeah, similar problem, but maybe more a problem with Fourrier?
	- Georg: bit more skeptical, because some input needed (perplexity) and there is no good way to choose which 
​- posterior cluster check?
	- elbow and silhouette
	- visualisation
	- Georg: silhouette is probably the best
- what do you use for a priory knowledge in the tree building?
	- distribution of priors 
	- x million reruns -> finds its own priors
	- C14-dates of projectiles added
	- there is no implementation of bayesian phylogenetics in R
