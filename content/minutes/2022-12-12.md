title: "25th regular meeting"
date: 2022-12-12
---

6 ppl attended

## Election of board members
- existing board (Martin Hinz, Sophie Schmidt, Clemens Schmid) re-elected by 100% vote of all other participants
- election cycles are two years

## Teaching Materials Map
- Clemens presented state of the map: https://sslarch.github.io/MapofComputationalArchaeology/
- List of tutorials is filter-able (names, authors, tags, programming language), links to points on the Map 
- more information can be shown with a "pop up" modal
- the modal doesn't yet work well in the mobile version (scrolling doesn't fixate on the pop up)
    - which is a common problem with bootstrap, but the common solution doesn't work, because we are using it via the elm libraries
    - TODO: this issue will be fixed by Martin, Joe and Clemens until next meeting
- when hovering over the map points, links to other points get shown with a dashed line
    - these are learning paths suggested by Sophie using the tags as a guide
    - TODO: if you know some tutorials better, please check whether you think the links are sensible
- ideas how to improve the map:
    - highlight starting points of learning paths
        -TODO  will be implemented by colouring the points on the map according to "beginner level" = green, "intermediate level" = yellow, "advanced level" = red -- the information is already given in the table
    - find nicer symbols, maybe castles, to represent the tutorials (TODO for Sophie)
    - add a sentence of explanatory information 
    - programming a decision tree, which might be interesting to newcomers. good idea, but implementation postponed.

- conclusion: looks great! kudos @ Clemens, who did most of the work. will be released after the modal problem has been solved

## issue of date for regular meeting
- there are some problems with regular attendance because of an overlap of meetings
- we will discuss changing the regular date next year, when most know their new schedules (prob. February / March) 
- Thursday was already put forward

## Social Media
- we need to discuss a potential move to Matrix and maybe Mastodon
- discussion postponed to next meeting


## Next meeting: Monday, January 9, 2023, 5 pm
