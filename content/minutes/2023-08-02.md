# Open exchange

## communication

- SIG SSLA Twitter / X has still a bit more interaction than mastodon, so we'll keep it for a bit longer
- we are moving from Slack to Matrix: https://chat.archaeo.social/#
- discussion to maybe bridge to the Computational Archaeology Discord https://discord.gg/Z9UXwjASM5
  - the discord had been very active for some time, but is now a bit slow as well
- Rchaeology group now has a channel on chat.archaeo.social as well
- at the moment, each "subgroup" has their own #general channel --> maybe these could be joined?

# Talk by Matthew Peeples
- book: Tom Brughmans, Matthew A. Peeples, Network Science in Archaeology, Cambridge Manuals in Archaeology, 2023.
 - fokuses on theory
 - gives introduction to networks in general and networks in archaeological research in practical
 - is not tied to a specific software, but gives exercieses, examples and general info on tools and software
 - has a technical appendix (mathematical formulas etc), but is in itself not very technical
- the online companion: https://archnetworks.net/   (on github and usable with binder)
  - is a living document, gathers
    - resources: Bibliographies (zotero), Tutorials and Teaching Materials, Archaeological Network Datasets, Archaeological Network Publications with Data and/or Code
    - https://book.archnetworks.net : is a big big practical Tutorial
      - starts with an introduction to R and ends at "do you want to contribute?"
      - includes explanation, examples, code, figures
      - does not so much focus on theory (that's what the book is for)
  - is build with Rmarkdown and bookdown, managed from Rstudio
    - enables interactive plots
    - makes code chunks in other languages possible (Python, ...)
    - bookdown template bs4 is created by posit, should hopefully remain stable
    - bookdown documentation is helpful: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ )

  - will probably be updated once a year, to make sure, code still runs
  - possibility to have a group working on it would be great, who wants to join in? (similar to https://r.geocompx.org/ )
  - was actually also reviewed, but Cambridge doesn't have copyright on it (otherway round, they had to get permission to use images from the book in the online companion, though that is where the code that generates the images is...)
 - Cambridge Manuals were sceptical about this "double format" first, but embraced the idea, now that they see it's successfull

- similar concept to the agent based modelling book: https://www.sfipress.org/books/agent-based-modeling-archaeology
- there will be a meeting between both "author groups" to discuss issues of stability, sustainability, overlap of tutorials and publication possibilities
