## Open exchange

- Ben Marwick:
	- Archaeology CRAN Task View
		- CRAN has updated the way task views are maintained
		- Ben et al. prepared a draft for an Archaeology task view: https://github.com/benmarwick/ctv-archaeology/blob/master/Archaeology.md
		- Everybody is invited to check it for completeness and suggest changes on GitHub
	- Incentivizing archaeological journals to request/support/verify computational reproducibility
		- Ben reached out to the editors of various journals to argue for more data/code sharing
		- He suggested two concrete changes:
			- The journals should support Open Research Badges (e.g. https://authorservices.wiley.com/open-research/open-recognition-and-reward/open-research-badges.html), which is a relatively easy thing for the journals to adopt
		- A more work-intensive idea involves to specify the new role of a "Associate Editor of Reproducibility". This role involves checking the computational reproducibility of papers, if the authors opt-in.
		- The editors were pretty receptive to these ideas so far - Ben has more meetings lined up
	- New paper: "Women in the Lab, Men in the Field? Correlations between Gender and Research Topics at Three Major Archaeology Conferences"
		- DOI: https://doi.org/10.1080/00934690.2023.2261083
		- Code: https://github.com/yichun33/archyconfgender
		- Ben's short introduction of the paper sparked a discussion about gender parity in our group. When we organize meetings we should be conscious about who we invite to maintain a balance - not just regarding gender, but also regarding other diversity parameters. We could consider formalizing this notion in our statutes.
- Florian Thiery (https://fthiery.de/) contacted the SIG SSLA to ask if any of our members would like to join him in chairing a session at the EAA2024. The session will frame/discuss research software as a special kind of research data.
- John Aycock asked a modified version of the question that already came up in the 31st meeting (2023-07-05). Back then he asked about programming language features archaeologists may desire. Now he focused on tools to translate from one language to another (transpilation). Keywords of the discussion:
	- Simpler ways to express chronological models (e.g. oxcal)
	- Visual coding, e.g. https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2019/10/my-javascript-internship-at-rstudio
	- Standardized data analysis pipelines for certain data categories: burial site data, compositional data
	- Managing site data is a major unsolved question of archaeology, despite many attempts
- Other news items, mostly compiled from Mastodon by Clemens Schmid, Sophie Schmidt and Ben Marwick:
	- Typewriter-styled maps in ggplot2: https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/creating-typewriter-maps-r
	- Interesting discussion "How to comment on dead systems in a review": https://archaeo.social/@Drdonnayates/111147003931585716
	- New fuzzy-join package: https://github.com/beniaminogreen/zoomerjoin
	- Zack Batist's PhD thesis is online: https://zenodo.org/record/8373390
	- webR and shiny become integrated - just as predicted: https://www.infoworld.com/article/3707250/shiny-r-web-framework-arrives-in-wasm.html
	- The ROAD database got published: https://archaeo.social/@sommer@fosstodon.org/110820072946462861
	- Inequality joins are now easy to do in the dplyr R package: https://r4ds.hadley.nz/joins.html#inequality-joins
	- The ADS has prepared a new archaeological data management guide/checklist: https://www.archaeologists.net/digdigital

## Conferences

There are currently open calls for papers for the CAA2024 in Auckland (https://2024.caaconference.org, until 19th October) and the ArcheoFOSS 2023 in Turin (https://www.archeofoss.org/2023, until 20th October).

## Next SIG Meeting: Wednesday, November 1, 2023

We invited two colleagues to introduce the Archaeo-riddle competition: https://theia.arch.cam.ac.uk/archaeoriddle
