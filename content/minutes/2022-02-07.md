## Conferences, meetings and sessions

- EAA2022: There are a number of sessions relevant for computational archaeologists. The SIG-SSLA twitter team has compiled [a thread](https://twitter.com/CAA_SSLA/status/1490742129081131016) listing some of them
- CAA2022: The CfP will open during the week commencing 14th February 2022 and end on March 21st. Consider to join the SIG-SSLA workshop or submit a paper to the related session

## SIG activities

- Ben Marwick Cran Task View proposal
    - Due to a recent change in the way [CTVs](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) are submitted, it may be possible now to create one dedicated to archaeology
    - Ben Marwick has prepared a proposal [here](https://github.com/benmarwick/ctv-archaeology/blob/master/Archaeology.md)
    - This does not interfere with [open-archaeo](https://open-archaeo.info/), which serves as a software database, whereas the CTV would be an R-specific guide or entry point
    - One issue of the current proposal is, that many archaeology-related R packages are not on CRAN
    - Contributions are welcome

## Next meeting: Monday, March 7, 2022

The Show&Tell by Florian Thiery proposed for this meeting had to be moved to the the next one in March
