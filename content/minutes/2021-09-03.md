## Organisational matters

- Zack Batist already sent out an invitation to the Google calendar on the mailing list. Everybody has read permissions to embed the calendar with their own ones, but only explicitly approved SIG members will get editing permissions to prevent abuse. Zack manages the permissions
- We postponed the discussion about moving the meeting timeslot once more. If somebody is affected and thus can't raise the issue in the meeting, please make us aware on the mailing list or the slack channel

## Conferences, meetings and sessions

There are a number of interesting, upcoming conferences/meetings: 

- CAA Australasia 2021, 16 – 18 September 2021, registration is open, https://au.caa-international.org/online-conference-2021
- CAA UK, 10 – 11 December 2021, CfP is open, https://uk.caa-international.org

Beyond that we have the EAA2021 this week, the SAA2022 CfP closes soon and the dates for CAA2022 are apparently still unclear

## SIG activities

- Teaching material list (Zack Batist reported the progress)
	- The discussion takes place in a dedicated Slack channel and every SIG member is invited to join
	- The list should be separated into meaningful sections/modules
  - The list should be opinionated, so it should only include relevant and high quality content
  - Each lecture/tutorial/unit should be contextualised by some systematic metadata (when, who, scope, language, programming language, ...)
  - Just as openarchaeo, the list should be mirrored to the Internet archive

- Conference list
	- We finally decided to make this a group priority and implement it
	- The events should be entered into the SIG's Google calendar and can therefore be maintained by a big group. The Google calendar integration allows for easy usability and good visibility, to both profit from the list and also keep it in mind 
	- SIG members are encouraged to embed the calendar with their own setup and enter new events. Zack Batist already provided a first list of upcoming conferences
	- The complex website integration planned by Martin Hinz was postponed for now. Instead we will simply embed the google calendar on the website
