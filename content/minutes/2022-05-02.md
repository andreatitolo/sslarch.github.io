## Conferences, meetings and sessions

- CAA2022:
  - Our SIG SSLA session has 5(+3?) submissions, which are now all in review.
  - There is still no way to submit workshops and we therefore still haven't submitted ours.

## SIG activities

- Teaching material list:
  - Sophie Schmidt and others started to work on a unified tagging vocabulary for the available list.
  - Clemens Schmid and Robert Bischoff came up with a creative solution to visualize the material in a fun and engaging way (Details omitted from the minutes).
  - Help is needed for all of these efforts: Check out the #teaching-materials channel on slack.
- The Open Digital Archaeology Textbook (Shawn Graham et al.):
  - Shawn Graham is open to hand the lead for a second edition over to another author/editor.
  - Volunteers can contact Zack Batist.

## Show&Tell

- Mikel Díaz-Rodríguez presented on the analysis in his paper *Evaluating the effectiveness of three spatial cluster analysis methods on 
Palaeolithic site location distributions in Galicia, NW Iberian Peninsula* (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2021.103323) and shared some of his experiences in making it reasonably reproducible.
